# Nearest neighbours

<!-- Matt -->

<!-- 
Get ideas on presentation from Harvard bioinformatics website. In particular, use of dataset with two variables (crabs??), because easier to display. Performance of classifier as k increases (should initially improve and then get worse - starts to lose flexibility).

In exercises could introduce application of knn to regression.

GENERAL:
SPLOM for displaying datasets with small number of variables

FEATURE SELECTION
filter methods  /  wrapper methods / genetic algorithms

## Example one

## Example two
