There are two ways to meaningfully intepret data. Mechanistic or mathematical modeling based Descriptive or Data Driven We are here to discuss the later approach using Machine learning. 2.1 What is machine learning? We use - computers - more precisely - algorithms to see patterns and learn concepts from data - without being explicitly programmed. For example Google ranking web pages Facebook or Gmail classifying Spams Biological research projects that we are doing - we use ML approaches to interpret effects of mutations in the noncoding regions. We are given a set of Predictors Features or Inputs that we call ‘Explanatory Variables’ and we ask different statistical methods, such as Linear Regression Logistic Regression Neural Networks to formulate an hypothesis i.e. Describe associations Search for patterns Make predictions for the Outcome Variables A bit of a background: ML grew out of AI and Neural Networks 2.2 Aspects of ML There are two aspects of ML Unsupervised learning Supervised learning Unsupervised learning: When we ask an algorithm to find patterns or structure in the data without any specific outcome variables e.g. clustering. We have little or no idea how the results should look like. Supervised learning: When we give both input and outcome variables and we ask the algorithm to formulate an hypothesis that closely captures the relationship. 2.3 What actually happend under the hood The algorithms take a subset of observations called as the training data and tests them on a different subset of data called as the test data. The error between the prediction of the outcome variable the actual data is evaulated as test error. The objective function of the algorithm is to minimise these test errors by tuning the parameters of the hypothesis. Models that successffully capture these desidered outcomes are further evalutated for Bias and Variance (overfitting and underfitting). All the above concepts will be discussed in detail in the following lectures. "]
