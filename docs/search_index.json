The SVM is an extension of the support vector classifier (SVC), which is turn is an extension of the maximum margin classifier. 7.1.1 Maximum margin classifier Let’s start by definining a hyperplane. In p-dimensional space a hyperplane is a flat affine subspace of p-1. Figure 7.1 shows three separating hyperplanes and objects of two different classes. A separating hyperplane forms a natural linear decision boundary, classifying new objects according to which side of the line they are located. Figure 7.1: Left: two classes of observations (blue, purple) and three separating hyperplanes. Right: separating hyperplane shown as black line and grid indicates decision rule. If the classes of observations can be separated by a hyperplane, then there will in fact be an infinite number of hyperplanes. So which of the possible hyperplanes do we choose to be our decision boundary? The maximal margin hyperplane is the separating hyperplane that is farthest from the training observations. The perpendicular distance from a given hyperplane to the nearest training observation is known as the margin. The maximal margin hyperplane is the separating hyperplane for which the margin is largest. Figure 7.2: Maximal margin hyperplane shown as solid line. Margin is the distance from the solid line to either of the dashed lines. The support vectors are the points on the dashed line. Figure 7.2 shows three training observations that are equidistant from the maximal margin hyperplane and lie on the dashed lines indicating the margin. These are the support vectors. If these points were moved slightly, the maximal margin hyperplane would also move, hence the term support. The maximal margin hyperplane is set by the support vectors alone; it is not influenced by any other observations. The maximal margin hyperplane is a natural decision boundary, but only if a separating hyperplane exists. In practice there may be non separable cases which prevent the use of the maximal margin classifier. Figure 7.3: The two classes cannot be separated by a hyperplane and so the maximal margin classifier cannot be used. 7.2 Support vector classifier Even if a separating hyperplane exists, it may not be the best decision boundary. The maximal margin classifier is extremely sensitive to individual observations, so may overfit the training data. Figure 7.4: Left: two classes of observations and a maximum margin hyperplane (solid line). Right: Hyperplane (solid line) moves after the addition of a new observation (original hyperplane is dashed line). It would be better to choose a classifier base on a hyperplane that: is more robust to individual observations provides better classification of most of the training variables In other words, we might tolerate some misclassifications if the prediction of the remaining observations is more reliable. The support vector classifier does this by allowing some observations to be on the wrong side of the margin or even on the wrong side of the hyperplane. Observations on the wrong side of the hyperplane are misclassifications. Figure 7.5: Left: observations on the wrong side of the margin. Right: observations on the wrong side of the margin and observations on the wrong side of the hyperplane. The support vector classifier has a tuning parameter, C, that determines the number and severity of the violations to the margin. If C = 0, then no violations to the margin will be tolerated, which is equivalent to the maximal margin classifier. As C increases, the classifier becomes more tolerant of violations to the margin, and so the margin widens. The optimal value of C is chosen through cross-validation. C is described as a tuning parameter, because it controls the bias-variance trade-off: a small C results in narrow margins that are rarely violated; the model will have low bias, but high variance. as C increases the margins widen allowing more violations; the bias of the model will increase, but its variance will decrease. The support vectors are the observations that lie directly on the margin, or on the wrong side of the margin for their class. The only observations that affect the classifier are the support vectors. As C increases, the margin widens and the number of support vectors increases. In other words, when C increases more observations are involved in determining the decision boundary of the classifier. Figure 7.6: Margin of a support vector classifier changing with tuning parameter C. Largest value of C was used in the top left panel, and smaller values in the top right, bottom left and bottom right panels. 7.3 Support Vector Machine The support vector classifier performs well if we have linearly separable classes, however this isn’t always the case. Figure 7.7: Two classes of observations with a non-linear boundary between them. The SVM uses the kernel trick to project the data into higher dimensions where a separating linear hyperplane may be found. Figure 7.8: Kernel machine.

We will be trying 9 values of the tuning parameter with 10 repeats of 10 fold cross-validation, so we need the following list of seeds. set.seed(42) seeds &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;list&quot;, length = 101) for(i in 1:100) seeds[[i]] &lt;- sample.int(1000, 9) seeds[[101]] &lt;- sample.int(1000,1) We will pass the twoClassSummary function into model training through trainControl. Additionally we would like the model to predict class probabilities so that we can calculate the ROC curve, so we use the classProbs option. cvCtrl &lt;- trainControl(method = &quot;repeatedcv&quot;, repeats = 5, number = 5, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, classProbs = TRUE, seeds=seeds) We set the method of the train function to svmRadial to specify a radial kernel SVM. In this implementation we only have to tune one parameter, cost. An appropriate value of the sigma parameter (used to the kernel feature space) is estimated from the data. The default grid of cost parameters start at 0.25 and double at each iteration. Choosing tuneLength = 9 will give us cost parameters of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64. svmTune &lt;- train(x = moonsTrain[,c(1:2)], y = moonsTrain[,3], method = &quot;svmRadial&quot;, tuneLength = 9, preProc = c(&quot;center&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;), metric = &quot;ROC&quot;, trControl = cvCtrl) ## Loading required package: kernlab ## ## Attaching package: &#39;kernlab&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: ## ## alpha svmTune ## Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel ## ## 280 samples ## 2 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39; ## ## Pre-processing: centered (2), scaled (2) ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold, repeated 5 times) ## Summary of sample sizes: 224, 224, 224, 224, 224, 224, ... ## Resampling results across tuning parameters: ## ## C ROC Sens Spec ## 0.25 0.9531122 0.8900000 0.8957143 ## 0.50 0.9573980 0.8857143 0.9071429 ## 1.00 0.9588265 0.8828571 0.9042857 ## 2.00 0.9570918 0.8800000 0.8914286 ## 4.00 0.9583673 0.8714286 0.8942857 ## 8.00 0.9602041 0.8657143 0.8857143 ## 16.00 0.9582143 0.8671429 0.8857143 ## 32.00 0.9546939 0.8571429 0.8971429 ## 64.00 0.9488265 0.8500000 0.8871429 ## ## Tuning parameter &#39;sigma&#39; was held constant at a value of 1.100359 ## ROC was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. ## The final values used for the model were sigma = 1.100359 and C = 8. svmTune$finalModel ## Support Vector Machine object of class &quot;ksvm&quot; ## ## SV type: C-svc (classification) ## parameter : cost C = 8 ## ## Gaussian Radial Basis kernel function. ## Hyperparameter : sigma = 1.10035896819859 ## ## Number of Support Vectors : 83 ## ## Objective Function Value : -478.4363 ## Training error : 0.110714 ## Probability model included. 7.4.5 Prediction performance measures SVM accuracy profile plot(svmTune, metric = &quot;ROC&quot;, scales = list(x = list(log =2))) Figure 7.11: SVM accuracy profile for moons data set.

Earlier we used k-NN for a regression analysis of the BloodBrain dataset (see section ??). We will repeat the regression analysis, but this time we will fit a radial kernel SVM. Remarkably, a re-run of this analysis using a completely different type of model, requires changes to only two lines of code. The pre-processing steps and generation of seeds are identical, therefore if the data were still in memory, we could skip this next block of code: data(BloodBrain) set.seed(42) trainIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(y=logBBB, times=1, p=0.8, list=F) descrTrain &lt;- bbbDescr[trainIndex,] concRatioTrain &lt;- logBBB[trainIndex] descrTest &lt;- bbbDescr[-trainIndex,] concRatioTest &lt;- logBBB[-trainIndex] transformations &lt;- preProcess(descrTrain, method=c(&quot;center&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;corr&quot;, &quot;nzv&quot;), cutoff=0.75) descrTrain &lt;- predict(transformations, descrTrain) set.seed(42) seeds &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;list&quot;, length = 26) for(i in 1:25) seeds[[i]] &lt;- sample.int(1000, 50) seeds[[26]] &lt;- sample.int(1000,1) In the arguments to the train function we change method from knn to svmRadial. The tunegrid parameter is replaced with tuneLength = 9. Now we are ready to fit an SVM model. svmTune &lt;- train(descrTrain, concRatioTrain, method=&quot;svmRadial&quot;, tuneLength = 9, trControl = trainControl(method=&quot;repeatedcv&quot;, number = 5, repeats = 5, seeds=seeds, preProcOptions=list(cutoff=0.75)) ) svmTune ## Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel ## ## 168 samples ## 61 predictor ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold, repeated 5 times) ## Summary of sample sizes: 134, 133, 134, 135, 136, 135, ... ## Resampling results across tuning parameters: ## ## C RMSE Rsquared ## 0.25 0.5942833 0.4693810 ## 0.50 0.5681785 0.4897385 ## 1.00 0.5498582 0.5066213 ## 2.00 0.5425480 0.5113917 ## 4.00 0.5412196 0.5182026 ## 8.00 0.5377407 0.5282356 ## 16.00 0.5421274 0.5233649 ## 32.00 0.5427669 0.5226361 ## 64.00 0.5427669 0.5226361 ## ## Tuning parameter &#39;sigma&#39; was held constant at a value of 0.01036271 ## RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value. ## The final values used for the model were sigma = 0.01036271 and C = 8. plot(svmTune) Figure 7.14: Root Mean Squared Error as a function of cost.

Do not worry about feature selection, but you may want to pre-process the data. Select a radial kernel SVM and tune over the cost function C. Produce a ROC curve to show the performance of the classifier on the test set. Solutions to exercises can be found in appendix F "]
