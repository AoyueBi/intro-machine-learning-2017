## Clustering algorithms

### K-means clustering

Pseudocode
```
randomly choose k examples as initial centroids
while true:
  1) create k clusters by assigning each example to closest centroid
  2) compute k new centroids by averaging the examples in each cluster
  3) if none of the centroids differ from the previous iteration:
      return the current set of clusters
```
